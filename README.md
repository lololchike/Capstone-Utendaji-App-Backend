## Technologies Used
Hosted on AWS EC2
1. The frontend is built on reactJS (with context api for user state management). 
2. Backend runs on: 
   * Express
   * Node.js
   * Mongodb
3. GraphQL used for perfomance data management (implementation ongoing)
4. Socket.IO for the chat feature. 

## Work In Progress
* Adding SSL to the EC2 instances to introduce HTTPS.

* Chat feature implementation. 

## Project Description
The tool helps enhance the productivity of employees by showing them realtime perfomace data.

## BDD
* There are three user types at this stage: Employee, Manager, and Admin. 
The admin's role is mainly user management: creating, editing, and deleting users and teams. 
* The employee has a view only access to all data, and they can only view their own data. 
* The manager can view and update the performance of all employees under them. They cannot view or edit any other employee. 

#### NB:
There is still lot's of ongoing works on the app and we will regularly update every new feature that we implement.
